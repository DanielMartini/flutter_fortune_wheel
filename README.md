# Flutter Fortune Wheel

Wheel of fortune widgets for Flutter, which allow you to visualize random selection processes.
They are highly customizable and work across mobile, desktop and the web.

## Quick Start

First install the package via [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_fortune_wheel/install).
Then import and use the [FortuneWidget](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_fortune_wheel/latest/flutter_fortune_wheel/FortuneWidget-class.html):

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_fortune_wheel/flutter_fortune_wheel.dart';

FortuneWidget(
  selected: 0,
  items: [
    FortuneItem(child: Text('Han Solo')),
    FortuneItem(child: Text('Yoda')),
    FortuneItem(child: Text('Obi-Wan Kenobi')),
  ],
)
```

## Examples

The wheel of fortune is the most iconic visualization. Unfortunately, its alternating slice colors only make sense, when there is an even number of items to be displayed.
Furthermore, it is not the best solution when vertical screen space is scarse. Therefore the FortuneWidget example above automatically switches between the fortune wheel and
fortune bar depending on the number of items and available space.

You can still use a fortune wheel under those conditions by instantiating it directly:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_fortune_wheel/flutter_fortune_wheel.dart';

FortuneWidget.wheel(
  selected: 0,
  items: [
    FortuneItem(child: Text('Han Solo')),
    FortuneItem(child: Text('Yoda')),
    FortuneItem(child: Text('Obi-Wan Kenobi')),
  ],
)
```

The fortune bar is an alternative visualization, which is smaller in the vertical direction, but is supposed to take the full screen width. See below for an example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_fortune_wheel/flutter_fortune_wheel.dart';

FortuneWidget.bar(
  selected: 0,
  items: [
    FortuneItem(child: Text('Han Solo')),
    FortuneItem(child: Text('Yoda')),
    FortuneItem(child: Text('Obi-Wan Kenobi')),
  ],
)
```
